  <h1 class="head" >Simran Rao: Maxims</h1>

  <p class="paragraph" >Maxims is a conceptual web project created by Simran Rao. Rao's maxims, or pithy sayings, have a morbid theme: while her
    site features an apparent google search for inspirational quotes, the maxims featured are actually the last words of inmates
  on death row, juxtaposed with scenic background photography often seen on inspirational posters. The format of Rao's site, which 
mimics that of an internet image search, surprises the viewer with a subtle twist and jarring contrast.  </p>
