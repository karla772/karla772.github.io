<h1>
API Prototyping: SAD Map
</h1>

<p class="p">
This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to report daily risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) in New York City. The site reports
symptom risk through changing collage elements that convey mood according to sun, visibility, and precipitation. In this exercise, I 
experimented with different methods of displaying the symptom report: the first approach utilizes a hover effect that encourages the 
user to mouse over content for pop-up information boxes to appear. The second approach uses hand-drawn boxes that are visible as soon
as the user enters the site.
