  <p>This morning, I was really <span
    class="adjective1"></span>. However, I got a <span
    class="adjective2"></span> start to the day, and went to Blick to buy <span
    class="artsupply"></span>. I like when my homework has me using analog supplies instead of <span
    class="computersoftware"></span>; I like when I only have to use my computer to check <span
    class="websitename"></span> or learn about artists like <span
    class="artistname"></span>.  I prefer them to celebrities like <span class="celebrityname"></span>.
    I love <span class="noun1"></span> but hate <span class="noun2"></span>. 
    I enjoy going on trips that involve <span class="pluralnoun1"></span>, <span class="pluralnoun2"></span>and 
    <span class="pluralnoun3"></span>. 
    If I’m not busy you can find me in <span class="verbendingining"></span>. 
    One of my many talents is being able to bend my <span class="bodypart"></span>. 
    My favorite numbers are <span class="numbers2"></span>and I love to eat <span class="foods2"></span>. 
    If you’ve made it this far you might actually be me.
