  <p>This morning, I was really <span
    class="adjective1"></span>. However, I got a <span
    class="adjective2"></span> start to the day, and went to Blick to buy <span
    class="artsupply"></span>. I like when my homework has me using analog supplies instead of <span
    class="computersoftware"></span>; I like when I only have to use my computer to check <span
    class="websitename"></span> or learn about artists like <span
    class="artistname"></span>.
